          <h2>Reflective Acknowledgement</h2>
          
          <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I used GenAI tools throughout Work Phase 3 to support different aspects of the project. ChatGPT helped me complete studio activities that specifically required using generative AI, generate images for my reflective design analysis, understand button states and micro-interactions, and clarify how to implement the DECO7140 API. GitHub Copilot provided scaffolding for CSS and JavaScript boilerplate code and helped me write meaningful comments that I then edited to match my specific context. Grammarly refined my written annotations and ethical response text to improve clarity and professionalism.
          </p>

          <h3>Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            For the studio activities, I used ChatGPT as instructed but made sure I understood the outputs before integrating them into my work. When generating images for the reflective analysis, I reviewed each one to ensure it aligned with my design concepts. For button states and API implementation, I treated ChatGPT's explanations as learning material rather than copy-pasting solutions. I tested and adapted everything to fit my project's specific needs. With GitHub Copilot, I never accepted suggestions blindly. I reviewed every snippet it generated, edited the code to match my structure, and made sure I could explain how it worked. The same approach applied to comments. Copilot would suggest something generic, and I would rewrite it to accurately reflect what my code was doing. For Grammarly, I accepted suggestions that improved readability but rejected changes that made my writing sound too stiff or altered my intended meaning.
          </p>

          <h3>Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I checked all technical suggestions against course materials and best practices for accessibility and usability. For the API implementation, I cross-referenced ChatGPT's advice with the official DECO7140 documentation to make sure I was following the correct methods. The generated images were used as visual aids for analysis, not as final design outputs, so I remained aware that they represented AI interpretations rather than user-tested designs.
          </p>

          <h3>Privacy and Sensitive Content</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I didn't include any personal or sensitive information in my prompts. All inputs were either generic coding tasks, conceptual design questions, or text that was already intended for public submission.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection on Learning</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            Using these tools helped me work more efficiently while still learning. ChatGPT's explanations of button states and API implementation gave me a better understanding of interaction design and technical integration. GitHub Copilot's suggestions exposed me to different coding patterns and helped me write more thorough documentation. Grammarly made my writing clearer without changing my voice, which helped me communicate my ideas more effectively in the annotations and ethical response.
          </p>

          <h3>Attribution and Final Statement</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I used ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Grammarly to support my Work Phase 3 project. Each tool had a specific role, from completing required studio tasks to generating visual aids, explaining technical concepts, scaffolding code, and improving written clarity. I stayed in control of how all outputs were used and made sure the final work reflected my own decisions, understanding, and authorship.
