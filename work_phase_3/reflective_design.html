          <p>
            The trust and safety mapping is on the right track, but it can go
            deeper. The ‚Äúvisa-friendly‚Äù badge on job cards is clear, yet it
            still relies on the person posting telling the truth. We can tighten
            this by only allowing the badge when the employer is verified or
            when a staff member reviews the listing. More steps like this can
            turn a good signal into a reliable safeguard.

          <h2>Meaning through Imagery and Tone</h2>

          <h3>Analysing an existing site</h3>
          <p>
            I looked at the UQ Alumni Network website because it serves a
            similar audience to Global Community Connect. The first impression
            it gives is warm and professional. The images show real people at
            events, smiling and interacting, which helps create a sense of
            connection and achievement. The site values belonging, pride, and
            community. Its tone is friendly but still formal enough to feel
            credible. The visuals and words work together quite well, though
            some of the imagery feels very academic and less focused on cultural
            diversity. It includes alumni and professionals easily but might
            overlook students who are new or still settling in. It meets most
            client needs but could do more to highlight personal stories and
            cross cultural connection.
          </p>

          <h3>Identity and emotional tone</h3>
          <p>
            Global Community Connect should project belonging, inclusivity,
            optimism, and empowerment. The emotional tone should feel warm and
            hopeful. Visitors should feel welcome, comfortable to share their
            stories, and confident that they are part of something bigger.
          </p>

          <h3>Homepage imagery</h3>

          <div class="image-section">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="assets/images/friendship.png"
                alt="People sharing a laugh at a park"
              />
              <figcaption>
                This image shows real people enjoying each other‚Äôs company. It
                gives a warm first impression and shows that the site is about
                belonging, friendship, and shared experiences.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img

                alt="Two people shaking hands or exchanging name cards"
              />
              <figcaption>
                This represents connection and opportunity. It shows how the
                site helps people meet, network, and grow through community
                support.
              </figcaption>

              />
              <figcaption>
                This adds a feeling of optimism and possibility. It reminds
                users that the site links real places and real journeys that
                start here and continue across the world.
              </figcaption>

              />
              <figcaption>
                This reflects diversity and pride. It shows that everyone, no
                matter their background, is part of one connected community.

          <h3>Homepage text</h3>

          <p>
            Join a vibrant community of students, alumni, and mentors from
            around the world. Share your story, explore events, and build
            meaningful connections that last. Together we grow stronger through
            culture, learning, and friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
            This short message supports the identity of the site by making users
            feel part of a shared global journey. It uses friendly and positive
            language that builds trust and motivation.
          </p>

          <h3>Annotation</h3>
          <p>
            The imagery and language work together to express connection,
            optimism, and inclusion. The photos create warmth and diversity,
            while the words invite people to join and participate. Together they
            support the client‚Äôs goal of building a global network and give long
            term meaning by helping users see themselves as part of a lasting
            community.

          <h2>Language and Expression</h2>

          <h3>Reviewing other sites</h3>
          <p>
            I looked at the UQ Alumni Network website again. Its tone feels
            friendly and professional, but it can sound formal and less personal
            for new international users. The language works well for alumni but
            does not always show the openness or diversity that a global
            audience would expect.
          </p>

          <h3>Inclusive language checklist</h3>
          <p>
            I will use people-first and gender-neutral language, avoid
            stereotypes, write in clear English, and refer to groups
            respectfully. These choices make the site easy to read and help
            everyone feel valued and included.

          <p>
            The revised text uses simple, inclusive language that feels warm and
            open. It avoids formal phrasing and supports accessibility by being
            clear and easy to read. This better matches the site‚Äôs mission to
            create a global space where everyone feels welcome and respected.

          <h2>Dynamic API Content</h2>

          <h3>Purpose and Reflective Design Connection</h3>
          <p>
            This section demonstrates how dynamic content supports reflective
            design by allowing users to see themselves and their peers
            represented on the platform. By displaying real community members
            and their stories, we create a sense of belonging and identity that
            goes beyond static content.
          </p>

          <!-- Container for dynamically loaded community members -->
          <section
            id="community-list"
            aria-live="polite"

          >
            <!-- Content will be dynamically inserted here by JavaScript -->
          </section>

          <h3>Annotation</h3>
          <p>
            The dynamic community content directly supports the reflective level
            of design by helping users recognize themselves as part of a larger,
            diverse community. The personal photos and messages create emotional
            connection and demonstrate that this is a real, active community
            rather than just a static website. This authenticity builds trust
            and encourages new users to contribute their own stories, creating a
            positive feedback loop that strengthens the community identity.

        <section id="accessibility-audit">
          <h2>Accessibility Audit</h2>
          <p>
            This audit used the IBM Equal Access checker on
            <strong>behavioural_design.html</strong>. Below are three issues I
            will address in the final build.
          </p>

          <article>
            <h3>1) Text contrast is too low</h3>
            <p><strong>WCAG:</strong> 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) AA</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Where:</strong> Header links such as
              <code>&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;a href="style_guide.html"&gt;</code>, and the primary
              button.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Low contrast makes links and
              buttons hard to read for many users, especially on small screens
              or in bright light.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Increase the color contrast of link and
              button text against their backgrounds so it meets AA. I will
              adjust according to the colour wheel to ensure sufficient
              contrast.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3>2) Focus indicator is not clearly visible</h3>
            <p><strong>WCAG:</strong> 2.4.7 Focus Visible AA</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Where:</strong> Navigation links like
              <code>&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;a href="site_map.html"&gt;</code>, and the current page
              link.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Keyboard users must see where
              focus is to move through the site with confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Add a clear focus style on interactive
              elements. I will use a clear outline on focus for links and
              buttons. I will also test with only the keyboard.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3>3) Form fields need grouping and clear relationships</h3>
            <p><strong>WCAG:</strong> 1.3.1 Info and Relationships A</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Where:</strong> Related inputs like text fields,
              textareas, and the file upload.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Screen reader users rely on
              structure to understand which fields belong together and what they
              do.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Wrap related inputs in a
              <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>.
