          <h2>Reflective Acknowledgement</h2>

          <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I used GenAI tools to help me build the Global Community Connect
            website. ChatGPT explained how to structure CSS with component
            skeletons and how JavaScript modules work with imports and exports.
            It helped me fix issues with the DECO7140 API by showing how GET and
            POST requests use headers differently. GitHub Copilot filled in
            repetitive CSS for cards, buttons, and forms. Grammarly helped me
            make my writing clearer. ChatGPT also made simple placeholder images
            for profiles and the hero section.
          </p>

          <h3>Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I made all the main decisions myself. I only used ideas from ChatGPT
            when they made sense for my site. I tested every JavaScript module
            and rewrote code to make sure I understood it. I checked all ARIA
            suggestions against accessibility guides. For Copilot‚Äôs CSS, I
            changed styles to match my design and added my own responsive rules.
            The accordion code started as a base, but I wrote the logic, focus
            states, and transitions myself. The generated images are only
            placeholders, not real photos.
          </p>

          <h3>Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I checked everything against course notes, MDN docs, and WCAG
            standards. I tested every API endpoint to confirm the headers
            worked. I added error handling for failed requests. I used a
            keyboard and screen reader simulation to test accessibility. The
            AI-generated images are generic and don‚Äôt represent real people. I
            made sure the site‚Äôs content about international students stayed
            respectful and realistic.
          </p>

          <h3>Privacy and Sensitive Content</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I only used public or technical questions with GenAI tools. I never
            shared student numbers, keys, or private data. All API tests used
            fake names and safe sample data. The contact email uses my student
            account, and no user data is stored.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection on Learning</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            These tools actually helped me learn better. ChatGPT showed me how
            to organize large codebases with clear structure. Copilot exposed me
            to new CSS patterns and naming ideas. Debugging the API helped me
            understand network responses and errors. Building the accordion
            improved my event handling skills. Most of all, I learned to
            question every suggestion and use AI as a helper, not a shortcut.
          </p>

          <h3>Attribution and Final Statement</h3>
          <p class="m-y-2">
            I used ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Grammarly for Work Phase 4.
            ChatGPT gave me explanations and code guidance. Copilot suggested
            patterns for styling and layout. Grammarly improved my text. I made
            every decision, tested all code, and ensured it met accessibility
            and design goals. The final work reflects my understanding, with
            GenAI tools as support, not authors.
