        <!-- SECTION 1: ALIGNMENT WITH CLIENT AND USER NEEDS -->
        <section id="alignment" class="section">
          <h2>1. Alignment with Client and User Needs</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Meeting Connect Communities Initiative Goals</h3>
          <p>
            The Global Community Connect website brings the Connect Communities
            Initiative’s vision to life by creating a digital space that
            genuinely helps international students in Brisbane connect, share,
            and belong. The site directly supports CCI’s mission to build social
            cohesion by providing a central online hub where people can access
            community resources, attend events, and exchange experiences in a
            safe, inclusive environment.
            <br />
            The Connect page is designed as a dynamic discussion board powered
            by the DECO API, where users can share stories, advice, and
            reflections. Each post shows the author’s name and timestamp to
            create authenticity and accountability, while an accessible modal
            form allows users to contribute easily. This setup encourages real,
            human conversations rather than anonymous, impersonal posts.
            <br />
            The Events page acts as the resource-sharing centre of the site. It
            highlights upcoming community events ranging from cultural
            celebrations to career development workshops and includes a simple
            submission form where users can propose new events. This feature
            empowers the community to take ownership of the space and reflect
            the initiative’s core principle of “celebrating and supporting the
            unique identities of communities”. Importantly, all activities are
            non-commercial, ensuring that the platform remains focused on public
            good rather than profit, just as the client brief requires.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Addressing Identified User Needs</h3>

          <h4>User Need 1: Central Hub for Resources and Events</h4>
          <p>
            From the user stories, Luca expressed frustration with information
            being scattered across too many platforms and wanted verified,
            concise listings rather than long, confusing pages.
            <br />
            To meet this, the Events page presents all information through
            consistent, easy-to-scan cards that clearly show the date, location,
            and a short description. The design uses visual hierarchy like large
            date badges, clear titles, and brief 30-40 word summaries so users
            can get the details at a glance. The About page uses an accordion
            layout that allows people to expand only what they need, avoiding
            cognitive overload.
          </p>

          <h4>User Need 2: Safe Community Connections</h4>
          <p>
            Safety and trust were recurring concerns in the user interviews.
            Maya worried about scams when searching for accommodation or jobs,
            while Chen reviewed data plug-ins carefully before subscribing to
            anything. Ahmed wanted transparency through descriptive links
            instead of vague “click here” text. These stories show that users
            will only engage if they feel confident their data is handled
            responsibly and that the community is genuine.
            <br />
            To address this, the Connect page includes clear author names and
            timestamps, giving every post a sense of traceability. The Community
            Stories section highlights detailed member profiles that show names,
            degrees, and universities, helping users verify authenticity. Forms
            on the site only collect essential data (name and email), as
            identified in the ethics analysis, which avoids sensitive
            information like income or sexuality that could cause profiling or
            harm. Additionally, we provided description for our 'Join Us' call
            to action button in 'Connect' to clarify its purpose and encourage
            participation.
          </p>

          <h4>User Need 3: Accessible Information</h4>
          <p>
            Accessibility came through strongly from the user stories. Ahmed, a
            screen-reader user, struggled with unlabeled forms and missing alt
            text, while Sofía faced issues with data-heavy pages that drained
            her limited mobile plan. Chen also appreciated simple, clear English
            even though he was fluent, showing that accessible language helps
            everyone.
            <br />
            The website’s mobile-first CSS design ensures performance and
            accessibility for all users. It follows WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines by
            maintaining strong colour contrast between text and background and
            scaling typography responsively. Semantic HTML headings (i.e. h1,
            h2, h3) let screen-reader users navigate logically, and ARIA
            attributes support accessibility feedback for dynamic updates. Every
            image includes meaningful alt text such as “Profile photo of Maya”
            instead of generic phrases. To assist users like Sofía, the site
            uses lightweight, optimised images and emoji-based icons instead of
            SVG files, reducing bandwidth use. The accordion components load
            content only when opened, further saving data and improving
            responsiveness.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2: ACCESSIBILITY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS -->
        <section id="accessibility" class="section">
          <h2>2. Accessibility and Ethical Considerations</h2>
          <h3>2.1 WCAG 2.2 Level AA Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            The website meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards through deliberate
            choices in structure, colour, and interaction. The text colour
            against a white background gives strong contrast, and the blue used
            for links and buttons remains readable while still matching the
            visual identity. All interactive elements use at least 44 pixels of
            touch area, which helps users like Ahmed who rely on screen readers
            or keyboard navigation. Buttons show clear hover and focus states,
            so users get equal feedback whether they use a mouse or keyboard.
            The site’s headings follow a logical order with one h1 per page,
            making navigation simple for assistive technologies.
            <br />
            Forms use matching label and id attributes so that screen readers
            correctly announce each field. When a form is submitted, aria-live
            regions politely announce success or error messages without breaking
            the flow. The About page’s accordion lets users reveal only what
            they need, supporting focus and reducing scrolling. Responsive
            design ensures the layout adjusts to mobile and desktop, keeping
            text readable and touch areas large. Motion is automatically reduced
            for users who prefer less animation, ensuring comfort for everyone.
          </p>

          <h3>2.2 Ethical Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            The ethics analysis from Work Phase 2 and ethical response from Work
            Phase 3 exposed how collecting unnecessary personal data like
            sexuality or income can cause harm, so this version of the website
            takes the opposite approach. The join form only asks for a name and
            email, with optional message or photo uploads. This small change
            protects privacy and prevents risks such as profiling, trust loss,
            and security breaches. The discussion modal and event submission
            forms follow the same idea, requesting only what’s essential. This
            reflects the ACS principles of Trustworthiness and Respect for
            Others by minimising harm and building user confidence.
            <br />
            Transparency runs through every detail. Required fields are clearly
            marked with both visual indicators and screen-reader labels. Help
            text gives short, precise guidance such as “Max file size 10 MB” or
            “Use 24-hour time.” When users make a mistake, the form tells them
            exactly what needs fixing instead of showing a vague error. This
            clarity builds trust and makes forms faster to use.
          </p>

        <!-- SECTION 3: VARIATIONS FROM A3 DESIGN PROPOSAL -->
        <section id="variations" class="section">
          <h2>3. Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
          <p>
            The final implementation focuses on five key pages instead of
            building the full site map proposed in A3. This decision allowed me
            to give proper attention to accessibility, responsiveness, and
            dynamic functionality within the A4 assignment scope. The chosen
            pages were Home, About, Join, Connect, and Events page. These pages
            cover all required interaction types. Home provides an entry point,
            About acts as a static content page with an accordion structure,
            Join demonstrates accessible form validation and API submission,
            Connect shows dynamic content updates through the DECO API, and
            Events blends static cards with a submission form to showcase
            multiple interaction styles.
            <br />
            The A3 proposal included extra pages like Resources and
            Opportunities, but they would have repeated the same kind of
            functionality seen in Connect, adding little value while dividing
            focus. By limiting the site to five pages, the final implementation
            demonstrates all the skills I have learned throughout the semester.
            <br />
            During development, the IBM accessibility audit revealed colour
            contrast issues that would have failed WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards.
            The lighter grey text proposed in A3 made some content hard to read,
            especially member and event metadata. To fix this, I replaced all
            light grey elements with the darker primary text colour used
            throughout the site. This improved readability on pages like Join,
            Connect, and Events, while the About page also benefited through
            clearer metadata labels. Instead of selectively adjusting colours,
            the fix was applied across the entire CSS system to ensure
            consistency. The result maintains the visual hierarchy through font
            size and weight, proving that accessibility improvements can
            strengthen design without changing its overall aesthetic.
            Additionally, the blue colour had to be changed to a darker shade to
            meet contrast requirements. This led to a variation from the
            original proposed colour scheme. The darker blue allowed for better
            readability of the white text.
          </p>

        <!-- SECTION 4: CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES -->
        <section id="challenges" class="section">
          <h2>4. Challenges and Strategies</h2>

          <h3>Challenge 1: API Integration</h3>
          <p>
            Deciding which API is suitable for my use case and integrating it
            was a challenging task. As most of the API endpoints mentioned in
            the documentation were generic, I had to experiment with different
            endpoints to find the ones that best fit my requirements. Debugging
            involved extensive console logging to identify whether issues
            stemmed from incorrect endpoints, malformed data, or missing
            authentication.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 2: Responsive Design Across Devices</h3>
          <p>
            Browser window resizing revealed layout breaks where content
            overflowed containers or navigation elements overlapped at certain
            viewport widths between mobile and desktop breakpoints. The mobile
            bottom navigation sometimes conflicted with desktop top navigation
            during transitions, creating doubled menus momentarily. I addressed
            this by implementing a single clean breakpoint at 768px using
            display: none to completely hide one navigation version while
            showing the other.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 3: Accessibility Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            The initial accessibility audit revealed several issues that needed
            to be addressed to meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards. The contrast
            ratios for text and interactive elements were insufficient, making
            it difficult for users with visual impairments to read content and
            navigate the site effectively. Rather than adjusting each instance
            individually, I systematically removed the problematic
            --color-text-light variable from the entire CSS architecture,
            replacing all occurrences with the properly contrasting
            --color-text. Additionally, using a darker shade for my primary and
            secondary blue colour addressed many violations discovered in the
            initial audit.

          <h3>Reflection on Audit Results</h3>
          <p>
            The accessibility audit showed me that most accessibility issues
            don’t come from big design flaws but from small choices that add up.
            For example, using a lighter grey for secondary text looked fine at
            first, but in practice it made things harder to read for people with
            visual impairments who rely on strong contrast. It reminded me of
            Ahmed’s user story about struggling with websites that weren’t built
            with proper structure or labels. Instead of fixing each issue one by
            one, I removed the problematic colour variable entirely from the
            CSS, which turned out to be a much cleaner and more reliable
            solution. What stood out to me most was how much this process
            changed my perspective about how something can appear accessible at
            a glance but still fail real users once you test it properly.
