        <h2>Reflective Acknowledgement</h2>
        <h3>2. Context and Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          I used GenAI tools during different parts of my project to support writing, coding, and design decisions. ChatGPT was mainly used for persona interviews and quick coding or styling suggestions, GitHub Copilot provided structural guidance in VS Code, and Grammarly helped me polish my written explanations so they were easier to read.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          For the persona interviews, I didn’t alter ChatGPT’s responses because the point was for it to roleplay as a user. Instead, I worked with those outputs to write the user stories and connect them back to the client’s needs. When it came to CSS helpers and ARIA suggestions, I reviewed what ChatGPT provided and kept only what matched the site’s structure. With GitHub Copilot, I treated its snippets as a starting point but always reviewed and adapted the code to make sure I understood it. For Grammarly, I accepted changes that improved clarity, but I rejected edits that made the tone too formal or changed meaning.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          I checked all code and design suggestions against WCAG guidance and my own notes. The user persona responses from ChatGPT weren’t changed, however, I recognised they were simulated.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Privacy and Sensitive Content</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t include any personal or sensitive information in my prompts. All inputs were either generic coding tasks or fabricated user persona descriptions.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Reflection on Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Using these tools gave me more confidence in both coding and communication. The interviews with ChatGPT saved time and gave me perspectives I wouldn’t have come up with alone. Reviewing Copilot’s code helped me learn more about structure, while Grammarly made my write-ups more clear without me losing the essence of my message that I wanted to convey.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Attribution and Final Statement</h3>
        <p>
          I used ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Grammarly to support my project. Each tool had a specific role to play ranging from emulating user interviews, to suggesting code and improving grammar. I stayed in control of how all outputs were used and made sure the final work reflected my own decisions, understanding, and authorship.
