          <h5 class="user-name">Luca</h5>
          <p class="initial-prompt">Act as Luca, 29, PhD candidate in Engineering. Primarily uses a desktop; schedules are tight. Interested in research seminars, mentorship, and concise summaries of key resources. Reviews third-party plug-ins for data collection practices before subscribing to newsletters.</p>
          
          <p class="question">Describe a time you searched online for settling-in help (housing, banking, transport, or visa). What made it difficult, and how could a website have helped?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I first arrived, I searched online for short-term housing near campus. Most of the results were either outdated or cluttered with ads, and it took me hours to figure out which listings were genuine. What made it difficult was the lack of clear comparison tools and reliable filters—some places didn’t even show if they were furnished or how far they were from public transport. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As an international PhD student, I want access to verified housing listings with filters for distance, price, and furnishings, so that I can quickly find reliable short-term accommodation.">
                  verified listings, concise summaries of costs and inclusions, and maybe even a map view with transport connections
            </span> would have saved me a lot of time.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Tell me about a recent attempt to connect with other international students online. What made it feel safe or not safe and why?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>Recently I tried joining a Facebook group for international students in Brisbane. At first, it seemed helpful—people posted about events and study tips—but I noticed many posts were from strangers promoting services, like “cheap rentals” or “fast visa help.” That didn’t feel safe because I couldn’t tell if they were legitimate. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a student, I want to connect in a moderated online community with verified profiles, so that I can trust the people I interact with.">
                  What felt safer was when I saw posts from students who shared their own experiences, or when the group admin verified events by linking to university pages
            </span>. A platform with proper moderation and clear profiles would make connecting much more trustworthy.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Recall when you looked for study groups, tutoring, or course tips on the web. What worked, what didn’t, and what would have improved the experience?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>I once looked online for a study group focused on engineering PhD students. What worked was the university forum—it had official channels where students advertised reading groups or coding sessions. What didn’t work was trying to use broader sites like Meetup; most events were either too general or inactive. I wasted time scrolling through old posts. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a busy researcher, I want a central hub that lists active study groups with summaries and schedules, so that I can join the right group without wasting time.">
                  What would have improved the experience is a central hub that clearly shows active groups, their schedule, and a short summary of the topics they cover
            </span>, so I could quickly decide if it was worth joining.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Describe your last search for part-time jobs or internships. What signals did you rely on to judge trust and relevance? What was missing?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>The last time I looked for part-time work, I focused on research assistant roles that could complement my PhD. I relied on signals like whether the posting came directly from the university’s job board or from a recognized institute. I also checked if the description was clear about duties, pay, and contract length. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a job seeker, I want job postings to clearly state weekly hours and flexibility, so that I can judge if they fit my PhD schedule.">
                  What was missing was transparency on workload—many listings didn’t specify weekly hours or how flexible the schedule was
            </span>. For someone with a tight PhD timetable, that detail would have been critical before applying.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Think of a time you tried to find community events or practical resources (healthcare, transport, budgeting). What got in your way?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I tried to find local community events—mainly research seminars open to the public—I often ran into poorly updated websites. Some events were listed without dates, or links led to pages “under maintenance.” For practical resources like healthcare, the problem was information overload: dozens of sites with long text blocks, but no concise summaries. What got in my way was the lack of a reliable, centralized source that gave me clear, up-to-date details in a quick format I could scan between my research deadlines.</p>

            Act as Maya, 21, first-year IT undergraduate in Brisbane. English is conversational; prefers Hindi for complex topics. 
            Shares accommodation and works casual shifts. Uses an Android phone with a prepaid data plan. 
            Primary goals include finding study groups, practical housing advice, and safe peer communities. 
            Has concerns about misinformation and unclear visa guidance.

          <p class="question">Describe a time you searched online for settling-in help (housing, banking, transport, or visa). What made it difficult, and how could a website have helped?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I first came to Brisbane, I searched online for advice about housing. I wanted to know which suburbs were safe, how far they were from campus, and what rent prices were fair. It was really confusing because different websites gave different information, and some posts looked old or maybe not even true. I didn’t know which advice I could trust. Also, a lot of it was written in complicated English, which made it hard for me to follow all the details. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a new international student, I want simple housing guides with real student reviews and translations, so that I can confidently choose a safe and affordable suburb.">
                  A website could have helped by showing clear, updated information in simple language, maybe with real student reviews. Even short videos or Hindi translations
            </span> would have made me feel more confident about choosing where to live.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Tell me about a recent attempt to connect with other international students online. What made it feel safe or not safe and why?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>A few weeks ago, I joined a Facebook group for international students in Brisbane. At first, it seemed good because people were sharing events, room rentals, and advice. But then I noticed some posts that felt suspicious, like offers for super cheap housing if you “pay in advance” or jobs that asked for personal details straight away. That made me nervous. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a community seeker, I want a platform that verifies student accounts, so that I know I’m connecting with genuine peers and not scammers.">
                  What felt safe was when students introduced themselves, shared their university names, or posted about group study sessions on campus
            </span>. Those posts had comments from other real students, and it felt like a genuine community.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Recall when you looked for study groups, tutoring, or course tips on the web. What worked, what didn’t, and what would have improved the experience?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I was struggling with one of my programming subjects, I searched online for study groups and tutoring. I found some groups on WhatsApp and Telegram, but the links were shared randomly and I wasn’t sure if they were trustworthy. Some groups had helpful students who shared notes and practice problems, but others were full of spam or off-topic messages. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a learner, I want one official website for verified study groups and tutoring, so that I don’t have to search multiple untrustworthy sources.">
                  What would have been better if there was one website or app just for students, where I could log in with my uni account and instantly find verified study groups, tutoring sessions, and tips
            </span>. Even having study materials explained in simpler English or Hindi would have helped me a lot.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Describe your last search for part-time jobs or internships. What signals did you rely on to judge trust and relevance? What was missing?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>The last time I searched for a part-time job, I looked on sites like Seek and Gumtree. I also checked Facebook groups where people post jobs for students. To judge trust, I relied on things like whether the company had an official website, if the job post had proper details (location, pay rate, contact info), and whether other students mentioned it before. If a post had spelling mistakes or asked for personal documents right away, I didn’t trust it. On Facebook especially, many jobs looked fake or too good to be true. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a part-time job seeker, I want listings that explain visa work-hour limits in plain language, so that I can avoid risky or illegal jobs.">
                  What was missing was a clear, student-friendly list of safe jobs — especially casual ones that match visa rules
            </span>. I often worried if the work hours were legal for international students, or if the employer would respect my situation.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Think of a time you tried to find community events or practical resources (healthcare, transport, budgeting). What got in your way?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I tried to find community events for students, I mostly searched on Facebook and Google. Some events came up, like cultural festivals or student meetups, but the details were scattered. Sometimes the event pages didn’t mention whether it was free, if food was included, or how far the venue was from campus. For practical resources like healthcare, it was even harder. When I searched “student doctor Brisbane,” I got a mix of ads and clinics, but none explained clearly if they accepted my student insurance. I had to call around, which was stressful because I wasn’t always sure how to explain myself in English. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a student, I want a trusted central calendar of events and resources, so that I can easily find healthcare, transport, and cultural activities.">
                  The biggest things in my way were unclear information, outdated websites, and no single trusted place for international students
            </span>. If there was one site with verified events, transport guides, and simple budgeting tips for students, it would have made settling in so much easier.</p>

          <p class="question">Describe a time you searched online for settling-in help (housing, banking, transport, or visa). What made it difficult, and how could a website have helped?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I first arrived, I tried searching online for affordable transport options because I wasn’t sure how student discounts worked here. The biggest difficulty was that many of the government websites had heavy images and long PDFs that took forever to load on my older phone and slow internet. Sometimes the page would just freeze and I had to restart the search. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a student on limited bandwidth, I want lightweight text-first guides for services like transport, so that I can access information quickly on my old phone.">
                  A website could have helped if it gave me a simple, text-first summary of the main steps
            </span> — like “apply for a go card here,” “upload your student ID there,” and “this is how much you’ll save.”</p>

          <p class="question">Tell me about a recent attempt to connect with other international students online. What made it feel safe or not safe and why?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>A few months ago, I joined a Facebook group for Latin American students in Brisbane because I wanted to find volunteer opportunities and meet people with similar experiences. At first, it felt safe because posts were in Spanish, people shared tips about part-time jobs or events, and some even offered to meet in public places like campus cafés. But sometimes strangers would message me privately, asking for personal details like my number or if I wanted to share accommodation. That made me uncomfortable because I wasn’t sure if they were genuine or trying to take advantage. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a community member, I want online groups where sensitive information is protected, so that I feel safe connecting with peers.">
                  What made it feel safer was when admins reminded people to keep conversations in the group and avoid sharing sensitive info directly

          <p class="question">Recall when you looked for study groups, tutoring, or course tips on the web. What worked, what didn’t, and what would have improved the experience?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>Last semester, I searched online for marketing study groups because I was struggling with a big analytics assignment. I found some posts on my uni’s student forum, but most of the links to group chats were outdated or had already closed.

                  What worked was when I stumbled on a small WhatsApp group link shared in a class discussion board — it was simple to join and people were active
            </span>. What didn’t work was that many of the university’s official resources were hidden behind logins or slow-loading portals.</p>

          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>The last time I searched for part-time jobs, I used a mix of Indeed and some local Facebook groups. On Indeed, I trusted postings that mentioned the company name clearly, had proper job descriptions, and listed fair hourly rates. On Facebook, I only considered posts where people gave specific details, like the location, contact info, and contract type. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a job seeker, I want a job board with verified employers and text-based summaries, so that I can save time and data when applying.">
                  What was missing was a way to quickly check if the company was legitimate without having to open heavy external sites

          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I tried to find affordable healthcare options, I searched for community clinics that offered bulk billing for students. The problem was that most of the clinic websites were full of images, maps, or booking systems that took ages to load on my slow internet. Some didn’t even work properly on my older phone.

                  What really got in my way was not knowing which information was current — some pages still showed COVID rules from years ago

            <p>I tried looking for study groups through my university’s website. What worked was that there were official pages with schedules and contact emails, so I knew they were real. But the problem was navigation — the site had too many menus, and my screen reader kept repeating the same words, like “expand, collapse,” which made it slow to move around. On student forums, I found some tutoring offers, but most of the posts weren’t structured, so it was hard to skim with headings.

            <p>I wanted to find local community events, especially ones with halal food or cultural activities. When I searched online, many event pages were on Facebook or Eventbrite.

          <p class="question">Describe a time you searched online for settling-in help (housing, banking, transport, or visa). What made it difficult, and how could a website have helped?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I first arrived in Brisbane, I searched online for student housing options. Many of the websites I found were either outdated or very commercial, pushing paid listings instead of genuine student experiences. It was hard to compare places because photos looked too perfect, and I couldn’t tell what was included in the rent or how far the housing really was from campus and public transport.

                  data-userstory="As an international student, I want verified housing reviews with clear maps and bilingual legal info, so that I can confidently evaluate options.">
                  A website could have helped by showing verified student reviews, clearer cost breakdowns, and simple maps connecting housing to transport and campus. Having information in both English and Mandarin
            </span> for legal or rental contract details would also have made me feel more confident.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Tell me about a recent attempt to connect with other international students online. What made it feel safe or not safe and why?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>Recently, I joined a WeChat group for international students in Brisbane. At first, it felt safe because people introduced themselves and shared helpful things like second-hand furniture or events on campus. But then some members started posting job ads or rental offers that looked suspicious—no clear company name, asking for upfront payments. That made me cautious. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a community seeker, I want moderated online groups with verified student profiles, so that I can avoid scams and fake postings.">
                  What felt safe was when students shared personal experiences and links to official university or council websites. What didn’t feel safe was when strangers tried to move the conversation to private chats quickly
            </span>. A safer online space would have clear moderation, verified student profiles, and guidelines against scams.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Recall when you looked for study groups, tutoring, or course tips on the web. What worked, what didn’t, and what would have improved the experience?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>When I looked for study groups in my Data Science courses, I mostly searched through Facebook groups and student forums. What worked was when people posted clear subject names and meeting times, so I could join without too much back and forth. Sometimes, I also found good advice on GitHub or Reddit for coding assignments. What didn’t work was the lack of structure—many groups died after a few weeks because no one took responsibility to keep them active. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a learner, I want an official platform that matches students for study groups by subject and schedule, so that groups stay active and relevant.">
                  It would have been better if the university or a trusted platform provided an official space where students could match based on subjects, schedules, or skill levels
            </span>, with options for both casual study sessions and more structured tutoring.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Describe your last search for part-time jobs or internships. What signals did you rely on to judge trust and relevance? What was missing?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>My last search was for a data science internship. I checked LinkedIn, company websites, and also some local job boards. I trusted postings that came directly from well-known companies or had clear job descriptions with responsibilities, requirements, and application deadlines. Verified company profiles and professional recruiter emails gave me confidence. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As an internship seeker, I want listings that specify visa eligibility, so that I don’t waste time applying to roles I can’t take.">
                  What was missing was a clear sense of how international students like me could fit in. Many postings didn’t say if they sponsored or accepted student visa holders
            </span>, so I wasted time applying only to find out later.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="question">Think of a time you tried to find community events or practical resources (healthcare, transport, budgeting). What got in your way?</p>
          <div class="response p-x-3">
            <p>I remember trying to find community events for networking and also information on affordable healthcare options. The biggest issue was that the information was scattered—events were posted on different platforms like Eventbrite, Facebook, or university pages, and there was no central place to see what was relevant for international students. For healthcare, I found it confusing to understand which clinics accepted my student health insurance. The websites used a lot of technical terms, and I wasn’t sure if I was covered until I called. 
            <span class="interactive-highlight-stories" 
                  data-userstory="As a student, I want a central site combining events and healthcare info in plain language (with translations), so that I can easily find what applies to me.">
                  What got in my way was the lack of clear, student-focused explanations and too many platforms to check
            </span>. A single trusted website that combines community events, healthcare guidance, and practical resources in plain language would have made it much easier.</p>
