        <h2>The Client Brief</h2>
        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering social cohesion
          by <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 2">empowering diverse communities to share their stories, connect with
          others</span>, and access resources that enhance their visibility and
          influence. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by creating
          platforms that celebrate and support the unique identities of
          communities across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams at Connect
          Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is tasked with developing
          individual concepts and prototypes for dynamic websites that align with
          CCI's mission and vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
          creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique identities of
          communities across Australia.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          We are commissioning the development of dynamic, user-friendly websites
          that <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 4">represent and support different communities</span>. Each website should
          <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 1">serve as a central hub where community members can share resources,
          highlight events</span>, and <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 2">foster meaningful connections</span>. The websites must
          not include any form of commercial activity, such as advertising or
          selling products. However, it is acceptable to <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 1">promote resources,
          events, or services </span> that are directly beneficial to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 4">reflect the
          diverse needs of the selected community focus area</span> while adhering to our
          mission of inclusivity,accessibility, and ethical design. Each website
          should also <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 5">celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community</span>
          and <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 2">support meaningful interaction and engagement</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>Community Focus Areas</h3>

          <li>Cultural and Heritage Communities</li>
          <li>Academic and Professional Communities</li>
          <li>Wellness and Mental Health Communities</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
        <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Community Members: Individuals within the selected community who seek
            representation, resources, and connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 5">General Audience: Broader society, who can use the website to learn
            about the community and its contributions</span>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 3">Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless interaction for all
          users</span>, including those relying on assistive technologies.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 4">Represent and celebrate the identity</span> of the chosen community,
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 4">recognising and representing the diversity</span> within the community rather
            than relying on stereotypes.
          </li>
          <li><span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 3">Provide clear, accessible information</span> and resources to users.</li>
          <li><span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 2">Foster meaningful connections and support</span> within the community.</li>
